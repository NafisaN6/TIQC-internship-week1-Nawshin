AI PROMPT USED:

Create a simple Node.js CLI todo app that can add, list, and complete todos using a JSON file.


REFLECTION:

The first version did not handle missing files. I updated it to create the JSON file if it does not exist.
I also simplified the tests so they can run without extra libraries.
