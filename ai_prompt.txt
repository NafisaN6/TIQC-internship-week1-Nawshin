AI PROMPT USED:

Create a Python script that reads a students.csv file and calculates the average GPA.
Skip invalid or malformed rows and round the result to two decimals.


REFLECTION:

The first version crashed when the file was missing. I updated it to handle FileNotFoundError.
I also added logic to skip invalid GPA rows and return 0 if there are no valid rows.
