AI PROMPT USED:

Create a simple Node.js CLI todo app that can add, list, and complete todos using a JSON file.


REFLECTION:

The first version did not handle missing files. I learned what a todo was, and how to check for it in the terminal of github codespaces. I am still a little confused though, on how it works, and why I can only really acess it within the github terminal.
